Hi, this is xdag  
As we know a lot computation task is under a hugh dag, aka Direct Acyclic Graph,
which can be very computation labor intensive so we can not get it done 
quickly on a single computer even with multi CPUs.
So, what I am thinking about is dispatching the task to a cluster, meaning 
distributed computation to get efficient.  
This is my work(x-dag) targeting for.
